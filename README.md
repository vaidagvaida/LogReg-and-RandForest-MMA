# LogReg-and-RandForest-MMA
Application of Random Forests and Logistic Regression on Mixed Martial arts dataset

Done as a part of Machine Learning module In collaboration with Gediminas Sadaunykas

## Description and motivation of the problem 

1.  Define fight instance as feature vector of differences in past performance and natural attributes, between two fighters.

2.  Investigate whether ‘crowd-wisdom’, approximated by implied probability from bookmaker odds, could be improved using declared features.

3. Compare and contrast Logistic Regression( LR), Random Forest (RF) and implied bookmaker probability, using reliability curves.
